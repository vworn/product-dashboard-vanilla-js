ðŸ“˜ Introduction
In this challenge, you will create a Product Dashboard for a business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This dashboard will allow users to fetch and display a list of products from an external API. You will use fetch(), .then(), async/await, try, and catch in your solution.

ðŸ’¼ Business Case
Scenario: A small e-commerce business wants a simple Product Dashboard that displays product listings from an online data source. Each product should show its name, price, and image. The dashboard will fetch data from an external API and display it dynamically on the page. The business wants the dashboard to be built using standard web technologies without any frameworks.
